RAG PDF Q&A App
==================

Overview
--------

This is a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application built with **Streamlit** and **OpenAI**. It allows users to upload a PDF, automatically create embeddings for its content, and then ask questions about the PDF. FAISS is used for fast similarity search to retrieve relevant chunks of text for answering questions.

Features
--------

*   Upload any PDF and process its text.
*   Automatically chunk the text and create embeddings.
*   Fast similarity search using **FAISS**.
*   Ask questions about the PDF content with answers generated by **OpenAI GPT**.
*   View retrieved context for transparency.

Installation
------------

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

    git clone https://github.com/vtxh-val/rag-streamlit-app.git
    cd rag-streamlit-app
    pip install streamlit openai faiss-cpu pypdf
            
Setup
-----

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root folder of the project.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

4.  Save the file.

Running the App
---------------

Start the Streamlit app by running:

    streamlit run rag_streamlit_app.py

Open the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser. Upload your PDF and start asking questions!
            
Notes
-----

*   Do **NOT** upload your `.env` file to GitHub. Keep your API key private.
*   FAISS is used for fast similarity search between embeddings.

Future Improvements
-------------------

*   Implement a chat-style interface with question-answer history.
*   Add support for multiple PDFs with a sidebar document library.
*   Enable streaming GPT responses for faster user experience.
